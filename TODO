Easy:
=====
o A song information dialog (both in tray menu and song menu)
o Shift+Arrow keys selects in add windows
  Depends on Gnome Bugzilla #133143
  Proxying events to treeview doesn't work, we manually need to mimic
  the multiple selection keybindings.
o Globally consume ACME keys
o Drag images from Nautilus or Epiphany to the album cover area in
  the PlaylistWindow to change the cover image.
  (This one is half implemented)
o Add DnD from Nautilus to the playlist window, adding to a) the library
  and b) the playlist.
o DnD m3u files to the playlist window should load them
o Clicking an ogg/flac/mp3 in Nautilus should append it to the Muine queue
  and play it. We can create a Song node for the file that is not in the DB.
o D-BUS service (Sergio Rubio is on this)
o Make drop-at-end work in the PlaylistWindow.

Tough:
======
o Portable player integration
  Need to discuss the UI first
o Implement music groups (Jorn is working on this)
  Need to discuss the UI first

  Include a group with orphan songs, and with never played songs by default.

  Groups editor, and a group selector that can be brought up from a button
  in the PlaylistWindow.

  Play random albums?

  Statistical next random song analysis?
o CD burning (Brad Griffith is workong on this)
  Support both audio and MP3 cds.
  
  Create folders for different albums (Artist - Album format)
  
  Create a playlist.m3u with the playlist order.
o Gapless transition/crossfading
  This should be possible with the current GStreamer components, but
  it's a tough one. Well, we could emit EOS a bit earlier than usual
  and have a fancy adder somewhere in the pipeline that does the mixing
  when a new song comes in ..
o Figure out how to get the peak value from the ID3 RVA2 tag.
o Handle non-UTF8 filenames and dirnames decently
o Improve first time dialog once again ..
  Perhaps a system-wide music folder gconf key, where sound-juicer dumps the
  music, and muine monitors it .. 

Graphic artists needed:
=======================

o Nicer application icon
  A harp would be cool ..
o Nicer default cover image

Depends on other components:
============================
o Directly use Pango# instead of using pango-utils.c
  Depends on Gtk#, Ximian Bugzilla #52575
o Translation
  Depends on gettext. Gettext 0.14 will have C# support.
o Monitor imported folders using FileWatcher
  Depends on Mono, Ximian Bugzilla #53807
o Make title and artist label one for easier selection.
  We need a proper Gtk ellipsizing widget for this.
o Use storage
o Support OGM files
  These will work once GStreamer supports them
o Use Gstreamer 0.7 for both playback and tag reading once it is solid enough
o Enable fixed height mode for the GTK 2.3 treeview.
  Depends on Gtk# supporting Gtk 2.3
o Use media stock icons and music-player icon (gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon) once
  we use GTK 2.3
  Depends on Gtk# supporting Gtk 2.3
o Use the GTK+ 2.3 fileselector, if it is available.
  Depends on Gtk# supporting Gtk 2.3

We won't have:
==============

o Internet radio support
o CD ripping
o CD playback
o Tagging support
o Volume normalization. We support the replaygain tag, the tagging
  application is responsible for setting these.. Muine is purely a player.

All of these because these tasks can be handled much better by specialized
applications.
