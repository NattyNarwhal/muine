Easy:
=====
o Use the GTK+ 2.3 fileselector, if it is available.
o Use a GStreamer 0.7 backend if 0.6 is not available. (Is Richard Hult on this?)
  The 0.6 backend should stay supported because 0.7 is not very solid yet.
o Add WMA support
o Add MP4 support
  This code can be stolen from Rhythmbox
o Enable fixed height mode for the GTK 2.3 treeview when it is available.
o A song information dialog, which will later be used for tag editing.
o Create ~/Music and ~/Music/Playlists/ if it doesn't exist, but ask first (Viet Yen Nguyen is on this)
o D-BUS service (Sergio Rubio is on this)
o Dashboard integration (Lee Willis is on this)

Tough:
======
o Volume normalization
  We need a volume normalization algorithm. We can just change the relative
  volume on the Player.
o Portable player integration
  Need to discuss the UI first
o Implement music groups (Jorn is working on this)
  Need to discuss the UI first

  Include a group with orphan songs, and with never played songs by default.

  Groups editor, and a group selector that can be brought up from a button
  in the PlaylistWindow.
o CD burning (Brad Griffith is workong on this)
  Support both audio and MP3 cds.
  
  Create folders for different albums (Artist - Album format)
  
  Create a playlist.m3u with the playlist order.
o Gapless transition/crossfading
  This should be possible with the current GStreamer components, but
  it's a tough one. Well, we could emit EOS a bit earlier than usual
  and have a fancy adder somewhere in the pipeline that does the mixing
  when a new song comes in ..
o Make drop-at-end work in the PlaylistWindow.
o Figure out how to get the peak value from the ID3 RVA2 tag.

Depends on other components:
============================
o Directly use Pango# instead of using pango-utils.c
  Depends on Gtk#, Ximian Bugzilla #52575
o Musicbrainz support
  We need a musicbrainz element for GStreamer
  We should also use album IDs from musicbrainz to distinguish albums with
  the same name.
o Support setting different equalizer settings, reverb etc for different
  albums.
  We need an equalizer element etc for GStreamer.
o Translation
  Depends on gettext. Gettext 0.14 will have C# support.
o Monitor imported folders using FileWatcher
  Depends on mono 0.30, which will have the FileWatcher class.
o Tag editing
  Depends on this to work nicely in GStreamer
o Add DnD from Nautilus to the playlist window, adding to a) the library
  and b) the playlist.
  Will be possible when gtk-sharp 0.16 is released
o DnD m3u files to the playlist window should load them
  Will be possible when gtk-sharp 0.16 is released
o Drag images from Nautilus or Epiphany to the album cover area in
  the PlaylistWindow to change the cover image.
  Will be possible when gtk-sharp 0.16 is released
  (This one is half implemented)
o Make title and artist label one for easier selection.
  We need a proper Gtk ellipsizing widget for this.

Current problems:
=================

o Hard to find music to play, only works when you know what you want.
