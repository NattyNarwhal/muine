Easy:
=====

o Use GnomeVFS

o A song information dialog (Jorn is on this)
  See http://huizen.dds.nl/~jbaayen/infodialog-proposal.html
o D-BUS service (Sergio Rubio is on this)

Tough:
======

o Plug-in arch, so that we can add things like dashboard and gnotify support
  without bloating the main build.
o Portable player integration
  Need to discuss the UI first
o Implement music groups (Jorn is working on this)
  See http://huizen.dds.nl/~jbaayen/proposal.html
o CD burning (Brad Griffith is workong on this)
  Support both audio and MP3 cds.
  
  Create folders for different albums (Artist - Album format)
  
  Create a playlist.m3u with the playlist order.
o Gapless transition/crossfading
  This should be possible with the current GStreamer components, but
  it's a tough one. Well, we could emit EOS a bit earlier than usual
  and have a fancy adder somewhere in the pipeline that does the mixing
  when a new song comes in ..
o Figure out how to get the peak value from the ID3 RVA2 tag.
o Improve first time dialog once again ..
  Perhaps a system-wide music folder gconf key, where sound-juicer dumps the
  music, and muine monitors it .. 
o Support mastroska and mp3cue

Depends on other components:
============================

o Directly use Pango# instead of using pango-utils.c
  Depends on Gtk#, Ximian Bugzilla #52575
o Monitor imported folders using FileWatcher
  Depends on Mono, Ximian Bugzilla #58234
o Make title and artist label one for easier selection.
  We need a proper Gtk ellipsizing widget for this.
o Use storage
o Support OGM files
  These will work once GStreamer supports them
o Fix the bug where keysyms that are assigned while muine is running aren't
  working.
  Depends on GConf#, Ximian Bugzilla #55877
o Figure out how to add new command line options (showing up in --help etc),
  and add gstreamer command line options and --start-hidden
  Depends on popt support in Gtk#
o Make SM work fully
  Depends on popt support in Gtk#
o Switch metadata and playback all over to GStreamer. But, GST should
  be a bit more reliable first.

We won't have:
==============

o Internet radio support
o CD ripping
o CD playback
o Volume normalization. We support the replaygain tag, the tagging
  application is responsible for setting these.. Muine is purely a player.
o Visualization. Other apps can monitor the ALSA device and make fancy effects,
  for example someone could code up an xscreensaver hack.

All of these because these tasks can be handled much better by specialized
applications.
