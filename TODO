Easy:
=====

o A song information dialog (in tray and song menus, and in add album window)
  This one is half done, I'm on this (Jorn)
o D-BUS service (Sergio Rubio is on this)

Tough:
======

o Add a library browser
o Portable player integration
  Need to discuss the UI first
o Implement music groups (Jorn is working on this)
  Need to discuss the UI first

  Include a group with orphan songs, and with never played songs by default.

  Groups editor, and a group selector that can be brought up from a button
  in the PlaylistWindow.

  Play random albums?

  Statistical next random song analysis?
o CD burning (Brad Griffith is workong on this)
  Support both audio and MP3 cds.
  
  Create folders for different albums (Artist - Album format)
  
  Create a playlist.m3u with the playlist order.
o Gapless transition/crossfading
  This should be possible with the current GStreamer components, but
  it's a tough one. Well, we could emit EOS a bit earlier than usual
  and have a fancy adder somewhere in the pipeline that does the mixing
  when a new song comes in ..
o Figure out how to get the peak value from the ID3 RVA2 tag.
o Handle non-UTF8 filenames and dirnames decently
o Improve first time dialog once again ..
  Perhaps a system-wide music folder gconf key, where sound-juicer dumps the
  music, and muine monitors it .. 
o Fix the bug where keysyms that are assigned while muine is running aren't
  working.

Graphic artists needed:
=======================

o Nicer application icon
  A harp would be cool ..
o Nicer default cover image

Depends on other components:
============================

o Directly use Pango# instead of using pango-utils.c
  Depends on Gtk#, Ximian Bugzilla #52575
o Monitor imported folders using FileWatcher
  Depends on Mono, Ximian Bugzilla #53807
o Make title and artist label one for easier selection.
  We need a proper Gtk ellipsizing widget for this.
o Use storage
o Support OGM files
  These will work once GStreamer supports them
o Use media stock icons and music-player icon (gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon) once
  we use GTK 2.3
  Depends on Gtk# supporting Gtk 2.3
o Use the GTK+ 2.3 fileselector, if it is available.
  Depends on Gtk# supporting Gtk 2.3
o Make the main window use a toolbar (and put "song info" button in it)
  Depends on Gtk# supporting Gtk 2.3

We won't have:
==============

o Internet radio support
o CD ripping
o CD playback
o Tagging support
o Volume normalization. We support the replaygain tag, the tagging
  application is responsible for setting these.. Muine is purely a player.
o Opening music files directly from nautilus
o Visualization. Other apps can monitor the ALSA device and make fancy effects,
  for example someone could code up an xscreensaver hack.

All of these because these tasks can be handled much better by specialized
applications.
