Muine is a music player.

You're probably wondering why another one. We've got Rhythmbox, Jamboree, and 
who knows what else. The difference is that Muine has a very different
interface which I find very comfortable to use. I dislike the iTunes model
that both Rhythmbox and Jamboree use.

(Yes, I also used to be Rhythmbox guy)
