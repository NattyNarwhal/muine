Muine is a new music player using some new UI ideas. The idea is that it will
be much easier and comfortable to use than the iTunes model, which is used by
both Rhythmbox and Jamboree. It is written in C and C#, using GStreamer for
music playback.

Our website is here:

We have a mailinglist, muine-list@gnome.org. More information can be found here:

Our IRC channel is #muine on irc.gimp.org.
