Muine is a new music player using some new UI ideas. The idea is that it will
be much easier and comfortable to use than the iTunes model, which is used by
both Rhythmbox and Jamboree. It is written in C and C#, using GStreamer for
music playback.

We have a mailinglist, muine-list@gnome.org. More information can be found here:
  
  http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/muine-list

Bugs should be reported at bugzilla.gnome.org, product Muine.

Our IRC channel is #muine on irc.gimp.org.
